# Overview of the school district analysis


After completing our initial analysis, the school board has notified us that the “Students_Complete.csv file” shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We have been asked to repeat the school district analysis and determine if these changes affected the overall analysis.

•	When the 9th-grade scores from THS were removed, the passing rate percentage was slightly lower. Without removing this data, THS students passed math at a rate of 93.27% and reading at 97.31%. With this filtered analysis, the passing rates are 97.02% for reading, and 93.19% for math.


•	The effect of these score changes are minimal. By grade, Thomas High School has no results for 9th grade, but the rest of its scores are unaffected.


•	Spending by the school is unaffected when averaging out across schools.



# Summary


The average scores for the district were not strongly shifted, but it decreases district-level scores slightly. This analysis may affect future expectations for the 9th-grade class since these scores are not accurate. The potential academic dishonesty reduces confidence in the Thomas High School administration and future scoring overall.
